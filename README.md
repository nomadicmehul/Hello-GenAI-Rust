## ðŸš€ Docker Model Runner: Fast, Local AI Model Testing

Here we are using Docker Model Runner for a faster, simpler way to run and test AI models locally, right from your existing workflow. Whether youâ€™re experimenting with the latest LLMs or deploying to production, Model Runner brings the performance and control you need, without the friction.

- `LLM_BASE_URL`: The base URL of the LLM API (required)
- `LLM_MODEL_NAME`: The model name to use for API requests (required)
- `LOG_LEVEL`: The logging level (default: INFO)

## API Endpoints

## Running the Application

You can run the application using Docker Compose or compile and run it natively.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for containerized setup
- [Rust toolchain](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (cargo, rustc) for native build

### Environment Variables

Before running, copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```sh
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env as needed
```

### Using Docker Compose

1. Build and start the services:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

2. The app will be available at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).

3. To stop the services:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

### Running Natively (Without Docker)

1. Install Rust toolchain (cargo, rustc).
2. Clone the repository and enter the directory.
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in required values.
4. Build and run:

   ```sh
   cargo build --release
   cargo run --release
   ```

5. The app will be available at [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).
